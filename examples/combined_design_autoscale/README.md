# Reference Architecture with Terraform: VM-Series in AWS, Combined Design Model, Common NGFW Option with Autoscaling

Palo Alto Networks produces several [validated reference architecture design and deployment documentation guides](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/resources/reference-architectures), which describe well-architected and tested deployments. When deploying VM-Series in a public cloud, the reference architectures guide users toward the best security outcomes, whilst reducing rollout time and avoiding common integration efforts.
The Terraform code presented here will deploy Palo Alto Networks VM-Series firewalls in AWS based on the centralized design; for a discussion of other options, please see the design guide from [the reference architecture guides](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/resources/reference-architectures).

## Reference Architecture Design

![Simplified High Level Topology Diagram](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/terraform-aws-vmseries-modules/assets/6574404/5199b4a8-2a59-4789-9ec0-870d97133acd)

This code implements:
- a _centralized design_, which secures outbound, inbound, and east-west traffic flows using an AWS transit gateway (TGW). Application resources are segmented across multiple VPCs that connect in a hub-and-spoke topology, with a dedicated VPC for security services where the VM-Series are deployed
- a _combined model_ for inbound traffic, where an AWS gateway load balancer (GWLB) is used to forward inbound traffic to the VM-Series in the security services VPC, as well as outbound and east-west traffic
- _auto scaling_ for the VM-Series, where an AWS auto scaling group (ASG) is used to provision VM-Series that will scale in and out dynamically, as workload demands fluctuate

## Detailed Architecture and Design

### Centralized Design
This design supports interconnecting a large number of VPCs, with a scalable solution to secure outbound, inbound, and east-west traffic flows using a transit gateway to connect the VPCs. The centralized design model offers the benefits of a highly scalable design for multiple VPCs connecting to a central hub for inbound, outbound, and VPC-to-VPC traffic control and visibility. In the Centralized design model, you segment application resources across multiple VPCs that connect in a hub-and-spoke topology. The hub of the topology, or transit gateway, is the central point of connectivity between VPCs and Prisma Access or enterprise network resources attached through a VPN or AWS Direct Connect. This model has a dedicated VPC for security services where you deploy VM-Series firewalls for traffic inspection and control. The security VPC does not contain any application resources. The security VPC centralizes resources that multiple workloads can share. The TGW ensures that all spoke-to-spoke and spoke-to-enterprise traffic transits the VM-Series.

### Combined Model for Inbound Traffic

Inbound traffic originates outside your VPCs and is destined to applications or services hosted within your VPCs, such as web or application servers. The combined model implements inbound security by using the VM-Series and Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB) in a Security VPC, with distributed GWLB endpoints in the application VPCs. Unlike with outbound traffic, this design option does not use the transit gateway for traffic forwarding between the security VPC and the application VPCs.

### Auto Scaling VM-Series

Auto scaling: Public-cloud environments focus on scaling out a deployment instead of scaling up. This architectural difference stems primarily from the capability of public-cloud environments to dynamically increase or decrease the number of resources allocated to your environment. Using native AWS services like CloudWatch, auto scaling groups (ASG) and VM-Series automation features, the guide implements VM-Series that will scale in and out dynamically, as your protected workload demands fluctuate. The VM-Series firewalls are deployed in an auto scaling group, and are automatically registered to a Gateway Load Balancer. While bootstrapping the VM-Series, there are associations made automatically between VM-Series subinterfaces and the GWLB endpoints. Each VM-Series contains multiple network interfaces created by an AWS Lambda function.

## Prerequisites

The following steps should be followed before deploying the Terraform code presented here.

1. Deploy Panorama e.g. by using [standalone Panorama example](../../examples/standalone_panorama)
2. Prepare device group, template, template stack in Panorama
3. Download and install plugin `sw_fw_license` for managing licences
4. Configure bootstrap definition and license manager
5. Configure [license API key](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/vm-series/10-1/vm-series-deployment/license-the-vm-series-firewall/install-a-license-deactivation-api-key)
6. Configure security rules and NAT rules for outbound traffic
7. Configure interface management profile to enable health checks from GWLB
8. Configure network interfaces and subinterfaces, zones and virtual router in template
9. Configure [static routes with path monitoring](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-1/pan-os-networking-admin/static-routes/configure-path-monitoring-for-a-static-route)
<details><summary>Details</summary>
<p>
Using multiple template stacks, one for each AZ complicates autoscaling and the Panorama Licensing plugin configuration. The virtual router (VR) configuration combined with path monitoring outlined below avoids using AZ-specific template stacks and variables.

**Virtual Router Configuration**

1. Create static routes for all internally routed CIDRs
2. Set the next hop to the default gateway IP of the trust subnet of the corresponding availability zone, which the firewall is connected to.
3. Set a unique metric value per AZ so that it doesn't overlap with other routes with the same destinations.
4. Enable Path Monitoring for the route.
- Source IP: DHCP
- Destination IP: Next Hop IP of the subnet of the corresponding AZ.

The AWS NACL applied to the trust subnets blocks the path monitor from pinging default gateways of the trust subnets in the other availability zones. This will cause the firewall to remove all routes that don't apply to the Availability zone it is in.

Below there is shown example of VR configuration with static routes and path monitoring:

| Name | Destination | Next Hop | Metric | Path Monitor Destination IP |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| app1_az1 | 10.104.0.0/16 | 10.100.1.1 | 11 | 10.100.1.1 |
| app2_az1 | 10.105.0.0/16 | 10.100.1.1 | 11 | 10.100.1.1 |
| app1_az2 | 10.104.0.0/16 | 10.100.65.1 | 12 | 10.100.65.1 |
| app2_az2 | 10.105.0.0/16 | 10.100.65.1 | 12 | 10.100.65.1 |
| health_az1 | 10.100.0.0/16 | 10.100.1.1 | 11 | 10.100.1.1 |
| health_az2 | 10.100.0.0/16 | 10.100.65.1 | 12 | 10.100.65.1 |
</p>

An example XML configuration snippet (for PANOS 10.2.3) of the described configuration can be found [here](template-asg-path-monitoring.xml), which after importing to Panorama, can be merged using the command:

```
load config partial mode merge from-xpath /config/devices/entry/template/entry[@name='asg'] to-xpath /config/devices/entry/template/entry[@name='asg'] from template-asg-path-monitoring.xml
```

10. Configure VPC peering between VPC with Panorama and VPC with VM-Series in autoscaling group (after deploying that example)

## Usage

### NAT Gateway Option

There are two use cases supported in this example. You can select your preferred use case by using the applicable `tfvars` file for your use case.

- `example-natgw-lambda-vpc.tfvars` - with NAT Gateway presented in topology, where NAT Gateway is used for Lambda working in VPC for autoscaling group and for VM-Series instances, which for untrust interfaces don't have public IP
- `example-no-natgw-lambda-no-vpc.tfvars` - without NAT Gateway, where Lambda is not working in VPC and each VM-Series instance in autoscaling group has untrust interface with public IP

### Deployment Steps

1. Copy `example-no-natgw-lambda-no-vpc.tfvars` or `example-natgw-lambda-vpc.tfvars` into `terraform.tfvars`
2. Review `terraform.tfvars` file, especially with lines commented by ` # TODO: update here`
3. Initialize Terraform: `terraform init`
5. Prepare plan: `terraform plan`
6. Deploy infrastructure: `terraform apply -auto-approve`
7. Destroy infrastructure if needed: `terraform destroy -auto-approve`

## Additional Reading

### Lambda function

[Lambda function](../../modules/asg/lambda.py) is used to handle correct lifecycle action:
* instance launch or
* instance terminate

In case of creating VM-Series, there are performed below actions, which cannot be achieved in AWS launch template:
* change setting `source_dest_check` for first network interface (data plane)
* setup additional network interfaces (with optional possibility to attach EIP)

In case of destroying VM-Series, there is performed below action:
* clean EIP

Moreover having Lambda function executed while scaling out or in gives more options for extension e.g. delicesning VM-Series just after terminating instance.

### Autoscaling

[AWS Auto Scaling](https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/) monitors VM-Series and automatically adjusts capacity to maintain steady, predictable performance at the lowest possible cost. For autoscaling there are 10 metrics available from `vmseries` plugin:

- `DataPlaneCPUUtilizationPct`
- `DataPlanePacketBufferUtilization`
- `panGPGatewayUtilizationPct`
- `panGPGWUtilizationActiveTunnels`
- `panSessionActive`
- `panSessionConnectionsPerSecond`
- `panSessionSslProxyUtilization`
- `panSessionThroughputKbps`
- `panSessionThroughputPps`
- `panSessionUtilization`

Using that metrics there can be configured different [scaling plans](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/autoscalingplans_scaling_plan). Below there are some examples, which can be used. All examples are based on target tracking configuration in scaling plan. Below code is already embedded into [asg module](../../modules/asg/main.tf):

```
  scaling_instruction {
    max_capacity       = var.max_size
    min_capacity       = var.min_size
    resource_id        = format("autoScalingGroup/%s", aws_autoscaling_group.this.name)
    scalable_dimension = "autoscaling:autoScalingGroup:DesiredCapacity"
    service_namespace  = "autoscaling"
    target_tracking_configuration {
      customized_scaling_metric_specification {
        metric_name = var.scaling_metric_name
        namespace   = var.scaling_cloudwatch_namespace
        statistic   = var.scaling_statistic
      }
      target_value = var.scaling_target_value
    }
  }
```

Using metrics from ``vmseries`` plugin we can defined multiple scaling configurations e.g.:

- based on number of active sessions:

```
metric_name  = "panSessionActive"
target_value = 75
statistic    = "Average"
```

- based on data plane CPU utilization and average value above 75%:

```
metric_name  = "DataPlaneCPUUtilizationPct"
target_value = 75
statistic    = "Average"
```

- based on data plane packet buffer utilization and max value above 80%

```
metric_name  = "DataPlanePacketBufferUtilization"
target_value = 80
statistic    = "Maximum"
```
