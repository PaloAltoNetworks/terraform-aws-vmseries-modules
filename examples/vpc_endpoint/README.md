# AWS VPC Endpoints Example

This example presents various AWS VPC Endpoints that are potentially usable for
general VM-Series examples.

The Gateway Load Balancer Endpoint (GWLBE) is a specific type of VPC Endpoint
which is **not covered** by this example, as it already constitues the core of
many VM-Series examples, like `tgw_inbound_combined_with_gwlb`.
