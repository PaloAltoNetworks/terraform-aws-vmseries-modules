variable "transit_gateway_asn" {
  description = <<-EOF
  Private Autonomous System Number (ASN) of the Transit Gateway for the Amazon side of a BGP session.
  The range is 64512 to 65534 for 16-bit ASNs and 4200000000 to 4294967294 for 32-bit ASNs.

  Complex input with the Route Tables of the Transit Gateway. Example:

  ```

    }
    "from_spoke_vpc" = {
      create = true
      name   = "myrt2"
    }
  }
  ```

  Two keys are required:

  - from_security_vpc describes which route table routes the traffic coming from the Security VPC,
  - from_spoke_vpc describes which route table routes the traffic coming from the Spoke (App1) VPC.

  Each of these entries can specify `create = true` which creates a new RT with a `name`.
  With `create = false` the pre-existing RT named `name` is used.
