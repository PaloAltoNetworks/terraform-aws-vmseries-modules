      listener_rules    = "a map of rules for a listener created for this application, see `listener_rules` block below for more information
    }
  }
  ```

  The `application_name` key is valid only for letters, numbers and a dash (`-`) - that's an AWS limitation.

  <hr>
  There is always one listener created per application. The listener has always a default action that responds with `503`. This should be treated as a `catch-all` rule. For the listener to send traffic to backends a listener rule has to be created. This is controlled via the `listener_rules` map. 

  A key in this map is the priority of the listener rule. Priority can be between `1` and `50000` (AWS specifics). All properties under a particular key refer to either rule's condition(s) or the target group that should receive traffic if a rule is met. 

  Rule conditions - at least one but not more than five of: `host_headers`, `http_headers`, `http_request_method`, `path_pattern`, `query_strings` or `source_ip` has to be set. For more information on what conditions can be set for each type refer to [documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/lb_listener_rule#condition-blocks).

  Target group - keep in mind that all target group attachments are always pointing to VMSeries' public interfaces. The difference between target groups for each rule is the protocol and/or port to which the traffic is being directed. And these are the only properties you can configure (`target_protocol`, `protocol_version` and `target_port` respectively).

  The `listener_rules` map presents as follows:

  ```
  listener_rules = {
    "rule_priority" = {      # string representation of a rule's priority (number from 1 - 50000)
      target_port           = "port on which the target is listening for requests"
      target_protocol       = "target protocol, can be `HTTP` or `HTTPS`"
      protocol_version      = "one of `HTTP1`, `HTTP/2` or `GRPC`, defaults to `HTTP1`"

      round_robin           = "bool, if set to true (default) the `round-robin` load balancing algorithm is used, otherwise a target attachment with least outstanding requests is chosen.
      
      host_headers          = "a list of possible host headers, case insensitive, wildcards (`*`,`?`) are supported"
      http_headers          = "a map of key-value pairs, where key is a name of an HTTP header and value is a list of possible values, same rules apply like for `host_headers`"
      http_request_method   = "a list of possible HTTP request methods, case sensitive (upper case only), strict matching (no wildcards)"
      path_pattern          = "a list of path patterns (w/o query strings), case sensitive, wildcards supported"
      query_strings         = "a map of key-value pairs, key is a query string key pattern and value is a query string value pattern, case insensitive, wildcards supported, it is possible to match only a value pattern (the key value should be prefixed with `nokey_`)"
      source_ip             = "a list of source IP CDIR notation to match"
    }
  }

variable "targets" {
  description = <<-EOF
  A list of backends accepting traffic. For Application Load Balancer all targets are of type `IP`. This is because this is the only option that allows a direct routing between a Load Balancer and a specific VMSeries' network interface. The Application Load Balancer is meant to be always public, therefore the VMSeries IPs should be from the public facing subnet. An example on how to feed this variable with data:

  ```
  fw_instance_ips = { for k, v in var.vmseries : k => module.vmseries[k].interfaces["untrust"].private_ip }
  ```

  For format of `var.vmseries` check the [`vmseries` module](../vmseries/README.md). The key is the VM name. By using those keys, we can loop through all vmseries modules and take the private IP from the interface that is assigned to the subnet we require. The subnet can be identified by the subnet set name (like above). In other words, the `for` loop returns the following map:

  ```
  {
    vm01 = "1.1.1.1"
    vm02 = "2.2.2.2"
    ...
  }
