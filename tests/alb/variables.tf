  Definition of an example "app" application VMs. They are based on the latest version of Bitnami's NGINX image.
  The structure of this map is similar to the one defining VM-Series, only one property is supported though: the Availability Zone the VM should be placed in.
  Example:

  ```
  app_vms = {
    "appvm01" = { az = "us-east-1b" }
    "appvm02" = { az = "us-east-1a" }
  }
