# Terraform Modules for Palo Alto Networks VM-Series on AWS

## Overview

A set of modules for using **Palo Alto Networks VM-Series firewalls** to provide control and protection
to your applications running in Amazon Web Services (AWS). It deploys VM-Series as virtual machine
instances and it configures aspects such as Transit Gateway connectivity, VPCs, IAM access, Panorama virtual
machine instances, and more.

The design is heavily based on the [AWS Reference Architecture Guide](https://pandocs.tech/fw/110p-prime).

For copyright and license see the LICENSE file.

## Structure

This repository has the following directory structure:

* `modules` - this directory contains several standalone, reusable, production-grade Terraform modules. Each module is individually documented.
* `examples` - this directory shows examples of different ways to combine the modules contained in the
  `modules` directory.

## Compatibility

The compatibility with Terraform is defined individually per each module. In general, expect the earliest compatible
Terraform version to be 0.13.7 across most of the modules.

## Roadmap

We are maintaining a [public roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/PaloAltoNetworks/projects/33/views/1) to help users understand when we will release new features, bug fixes and enhancements.

## Versioning

These modules follow the principles of [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/). You can find each new release,
along with the changelog, on the GitHub [Releases](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/terraform-aws-vmseries-modules/releases) page.
