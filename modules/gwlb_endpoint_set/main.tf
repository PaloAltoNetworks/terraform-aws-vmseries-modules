  # Routes like these are special in that they are on the "edge", that is they are part of an IGW route table,
  # and AWS allows their destinations to only be:
  #     - The entire IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR block of your VPC. (Not interesting, as we always want AZ-specific next hops.)
  #     - The entire IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR block of a subnet in your VPC. (This is used here.)

  # Aside: a VGW has the same rules, except it only supports individual NICs but not GWLB. Such lack
  # of GWLB balancing looks like a temporary AWS limitation.
