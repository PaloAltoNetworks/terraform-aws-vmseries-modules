variable "balance_rules" {
  description = <<-EOF
  A object that contains the actual listener, target group and healthcheck configuration. 
  It consist of maps of applications like follows:

  ```hcl
  balance_rules = {
    "application_name" = {
      protocol            = "communication protocol, since this is a NLB module accepted values are TCP or TLS"
      port                = "communication port"
      health_check_port   = "port used by the target group healthcheck"
      threshold           = "number of consecutive health checks before considering target healthy or unhealthy, defaults to 3"
      interval            = "time between each health check, between 5 and 300 seconds, defaults to 30s"
      certificate_arn     = "this is the arn of a certificate used only for TLS listeners"
      alpn_policy         = "ALPN policy name, for possible values check (terraform documentation)[https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/lb_listener#alpn_policy], defaults to `None`"
    }
  }
  ```

  `protocol` and `port` are used for `listener`, `target group` and `target group attachment`. Partially also for health checks (see below). By default all target group have all available FW attached (from all AZs).

  All listeners are always of forward action.

  All target groups are always set to `ip`. This way we make sure that the traffic is routed to the correct FW interface.

  Healthchecks are by default of type TCP. Reason for that is the fact, that HTTP requests might flow through the FW to the actual application. So instead of checking the status of the FW we might check the status of the application.

  You have an option to specify a health check port. This way you can set up a Management Profile with an Administrative Management Service limited only to NLBs private IPs and use a port for that service as the health check port. This way you make sure you separate the actual health check from the application rule's port.

  EXAMPLE

  balance_rules = {

      protocol          = "TCP"

      health_check_port = "22"
      threshold         = 2
      interval          = 10
    }
    "HTTP_application" = {
      protocol            = "TCP"
      port                = "80"
      threshold           = 2

The subnet can be identified by the subnet set name (like above).
