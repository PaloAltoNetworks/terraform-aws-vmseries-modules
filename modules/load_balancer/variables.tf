Nested Map of AWS Network Load balancers to create and the "apps" (target groups, listeners) associated with each.

- `key` (string) :  Unique reference for each NLB. Only used to reference resources inside of terraform
- `name` (string) : Name of NLB (ELB Names in AWS are not tag based, changing name is destructive)
- `internal` (bool) : Default `false`. Set false for public NLB (typical for VM-Series deployment)
- `enable_cross_zone_load_balancing` (bool) :  Set to true to enable each front-end to send traffic to all targets ()
- `eips` (bool) : Set `true` to create static EIPs for the NLB
- `apps` (map) :  Nested map of "apps" associated with this NLB
--> `key` (string) :  Unique reference for each app of this NLB. Only used to reference resources inside of terraform
--> `name` (string) : Name Tag for the Target Group
--> `protocol` (string) : `TCP`, `TLS`, `UDP`, or `TCP_UDP`
--> `listener_port` (string) :  Port for the NLB listener
--> `target_port` (string) :  Port for the target group for VM-Series translation. Typically will be unique per app

Example:
```
nlbs = {
  nlb01 = {
    name                             = "nlb01-inbound"
    internal                         = false
    eips                             = true
    enable_cross_zone_load_balancing = true
    apps = {
      app01 = {
        name          = "inbound-nlb01-app01-ssh"
        protocol      = "TCP"
        listener_port = "22"
        target_port   = "5001"
      }
      app02 = {

        protocol      = "TCP"
        listener_port = "443"
        target_port   = "5002"
