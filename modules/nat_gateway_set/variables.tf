variable "eips" {
  description = <<-EOF
    Optional map of Elastic IP attributes. Each key is an Availability Zone name, for example "us-east-1b". Each entry has optional attributes `name`, `public_ip`, `id`.
    These are mainly useful to select a pre-existing Elastic IP when create_eip is false. Example:

    ```
    eips = {
        "us-east-1a" = { id = aws_eip.a.id }
        "us-east-1b" = { id = aws_eip.b.id }
    }
    ```

    The `name` attribute can be used both for selecting the pre-existing Elastic IP, or for customizing a newly created Elastic IP:

    ```
    eips = {
        "us-east-1a" = { name = "Alice" }
        "us-east-1b" = { name = "Bob" }
    }
    ```

  default     = {}

}

variable "subnets" {
  description = <<-EOF
  Map of Subnets where to create the NAT Gateways. Each map's key is the availability zone name and each map's object has an attribute `id` identifying AWS Subnet. Importantly, the traffic returning from the NAT Gateway uses the Subnet's route table.
  The keys of this input map are used for the output map `endpoints`.
  Example for users of module `subnet_set`:
  ```
  subnets = module.subnet_set.subnets
  ```
  Example:
  ```
  subnets = {
    "us-east-1a" = { id = "snet-123007" }
    "us-east-1b" = { id = "snet-123008" }
  }
